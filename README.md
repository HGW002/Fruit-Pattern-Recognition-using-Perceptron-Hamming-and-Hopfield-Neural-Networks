# Fruit-Pattern-Recognition-using-Perceptron-Hamming-and-Hopfield-Neural-Networks
MATLAB implementation of Perceptron, Hamming, and Hopfield neural networks to classify fruit patterns based on sensor input data (shape, texture, and weight). This project is based on Exercise E3.1 from the book "Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation" by Simon Haykin and Martin T. Hagan.
